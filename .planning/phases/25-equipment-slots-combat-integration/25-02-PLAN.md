<objective>
Implement the EquipmentSystem to dynamically calculate EffectiveStats and integrate it into the player creation and main game loop.

Purpose: Providing the automated engine that translates equipped items into stat bonuses.
Output: EquipmentSystem and updated player initialization.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Implement EquipmentSystem</name>
  <files>ecs/systems/equipment_system.py</files>
  <action>
    Create ecs/systems/equipment_system.py:
    1. Iterate over entities with both Stats and Equipment.
    2. Sum base values:
       - Use Stats.hp (current health) as the base for EffectiveStats.hp.
       - Use Stats.base_max_hp, Stats.base_power, Stats.base_defense, etc., for the other stats.
    3. Iterate over all item IDs in Equipment.slots.
    4. For each item ID, if it exists and has StatModifiers, add those modifiers to the totals.
       - Note: StatModifiers.hp applies to both max_hp and current hp.
    5. Update (or create) the EffectiveStats component on the entity with the final totals.
  </action>
  <verify>Check logic for stat summation in a unit test or manual check.</verify>
  <done>EquipmentSystem correctly sums stats from base and equipment.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Update Player Setup and Registration</name>
  <files>services/party_service.py, game_states.py</files>
  <action>
    1. Update PartyService.create_initial_party in services/party_service.py to include Equipment() and EffectiveStats(...) with base values.
    2. Update Game.startup in game_states.py to initialize and register EquipmentSystem (esper.add_processor).
    3. Ensure EquipmentSystem is added to the removal list in startup to avoid duplicates.
  </action>
  <verify>Start the game and check if the player entity has Equipment and EffectiveStats components.</verify>
  <done>Player has equipment components and system is running.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
Ensure EquipmentSystem runs without error and player components are present.
</verification>

<success_criteria>
1. EquipmentSystem correctly calculates totals.
2. Player entity initialized with empty Equipment slots.
3. Player entity initialized with EffectiveStats mirroring base Stats.
4. EquipmentSystem registered in game loop.
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/25-equipment-slots-combat-integration/25-02-SUMMARY.md`
